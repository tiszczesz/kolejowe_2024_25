Windswept Adan is the seventh studio album by Japanese
singer-songwriter Ichiko Aoba (pictured), released on 2 December 2020 by her label, Hermine. The concept album follows
the story of a young girl who is sent away by her family
to the fictional island of Adan. Aoba and composer
Taro Umebayashi wrote, composed, arranged,
and produced the music for the album, which 
was preceded by one single, "Porcelain". Windswept 
Adan is a chamber folk and psychedelic folk album 
with elements of jazz, classical, and ambient music. 
Marking a departure from Aoba's earlier minimalist 
instrumentation, it includes a celesta, wind chimes, 
string arrangements, and vocal performances. 
The album received widespread critical acclaim for 
its arrangements, instrumentation, and worldbuilding. 
Upon its release, the album debuted at number 82 on 
the Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart and number 88 on 
the Oricon Albums Chart. Aoba supported the album 
with her first international tour
